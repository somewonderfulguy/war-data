## Icons

For icons use only `react-icons` library. You can find the list of icons [here](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

Preferably use `react-icons/lu` ([Lucide](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/lu/)).

For naming convention use the following pattern: `IconNameIcon`.\
For example, `import { LuSun as SunIcon } from 'react-icons/lu';`
